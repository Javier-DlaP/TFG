\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

Perception systems in autonomous vehicles are those that allow to understand what is happening in the environment. This work focuses on the study of perception techniques using LiDAR technologies, both classical techniques and techniques based on Deep Learning. This study presents the implementations designed for the Techs4AgeCar project vehicle, offering the implementation based on Deep Learning an improvement in the detection within the perception layer using only LiDAR.\par
Together with the single sensor based implementation, a sensor fusion model between camera and LiDAR is presented, based on the detection system explained in this TFG and the camera based work done with a colleague from the RobeSafe research group.\par
Finally, for the evaluation of autonomous driving systems on the CARLA simulator, the AD DevKit project is explained, on which the perception layer for the evaluation of 2D and 3D detection systems on this simulator is performed.
